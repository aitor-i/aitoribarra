  developer: `
    My name is Aitor Ibarra and actually I am a React developer. I studied chemistry at the University of the basque country (UPV/EHU) but after that I have acquired interesting programming knowledge.\n

    Talking about my programming knowledge I first learned Python and its libraries for data science but these last years I have started learning frontend technologies like React, Javascript, and Typescript. I also have experience using backend javascript libraries like Express.\n

Furthermore, I am familiar with working with Agile/Scrum and Extreme programming methodologies. I also have some experience working with TDD methodologies, with Jest, React testing library, and Mock Service Worker to be precise.
