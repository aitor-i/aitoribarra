  developer: `
    My name is Aitor Ibarra and actually I am a React developer. I studied chemistry at the University of the basque country (UPV/EHU) but after that I have acquired interesting programming knowledge.\n

    Talking about my programming knowledge I first learned Python and its libraries for data science but these last years I have started learning frontend technologies like React, Javascript, and Typescript. I also have experience using backend javascript libraries like Express.\n

Furthermore, I am familiar with working with Agile/Scrum and Extreme programming methodologies. I also have some experience working with TDD methodologies, with Jest, React testing library, and Mock Service Worker to be precise.

  chemist: `Talking about my chemistry knowledge, I studied chemistry in the faculty of chemistry in Donostia. I specialized in macro molecular science in polymers and adhesive technologies to be precise. I also studied deeply film formation precesses. \n 
  
  Futhermore, I have a good understanding of polymer characterization techniques as gas chromatography, HPLC, or GPC.
  
  Nowadays, I use to write new Wikipedia entries or extend existing ones on polymers related topics, when ever I have got some time.

  photographer: `Photography has been one of my latest hobbies, I had always have some curiosity and good taste for photos and compositions, that may be the reason why I fished working as a front end developer.
  
  Because of some unexpected events I ended owning really powerful photography gear, boosting that previously mentioned curiosity to a new level.

  I hope that in a recent future I will have enough time and photos to make a proper gallery in this page. So stay tuned.
